# Timetable
## Creating the normal html structure
- typed control !
## Inputing the title  
-Gave the table the name Timetable
## Inputting Header 1
- Named it: MASTER TIMETABLE FOR 2024/2025 ACADEMIC YEAR
## Inputting table headers with <th> 
- put in all the headers as presentented in the first row of the table.
- for the empty header I left the table header empty
## Imputting rows
- Used rowspan "5" for each day to ensure that eacy day has a span of 5 rows
- for the first Monday row, I imput a rowspan of "30" and a bold font to ensure that the bolded "FORM TUTOR'S TIME" runs vertically all the 5 days.
    - this was not repeated in the other days as the writing was spaced throughout vertially.
- for devotion, lunch and break I spaced the writing within the displayed rows using rowspan and the number of row "5" and then filled in the subjects in the other data spaces. This was not repeated across Y 8-Y11, as it automatically had the break and lunck writing vertically across each.
- For the other days, I repeatedc the rowspand for each day, break and lunch and the event at 3:10-3:55
## Styling
-Extern CSS
I imported the style.css to the html so it can style the timetable, the table header and the table data using (link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css") with opening and closing tags.
- Internal CSS
* I gave time, day, lunch and break class and then I did style the table and its contents under the head section as I worked through to ensure each meet the expectation.
* (all shown on the index.html and style.css)
* However, some styles were inline
