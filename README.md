# Timetable
## Creating the normal html structure
- typed control !
## Inputing the title  
-Gave the table the name Timetable
## Inputting Header 1
- Named it: MASTER TIMETABLE FOR 2024/2025 ACADEMIC YEAR
## Inputting table headers with <th> 
- put in all the headers as presentented in the first row of the table.
- for the empty header I left the table header empty
## Imputting rows
- Used rowspan "5" for each day to ensure that eacy day has a span of 5 rows
- for the first Monday row, I imput a rowspan of "30" and a bold font to ensure that the bolded FORM TUTOR'S TIME runs vertically all the 5 days.
    - this was not repeated in the other days as the writing was spaced throughout vertially.
- for devotion, lunch and break I spaced the writing within the displayed rows using rowspan and the number of row "5" and then filled in the subjects in the other data spaces. This was not repeated across Y 8-Y11, as it automatically had the break and lunck writing vertically across each.
- For the other days, I repeatedc the rowspand for each day, break and lunch and the event at 3:10-3:55
- I did style the table and its contents under the title as I worked through to ensure each meet the expectation.
